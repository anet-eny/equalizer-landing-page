# Equalizer Landing Page

A simple responsive summary card component built with React and Tailwind CSS. This project is a solution to the [Equalizer Landing Page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/equalizer-landing-page-7VJ4gp3DE).

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: Designed with Tailwindâ€™s responsive utilities to adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.
- **Reusable Components**: Structured into clear React components for maintainability and scalability.
- **Custom Tailwind Variables**: Colors, typography and spacings are defined using CSS variables and integrated into Tailwind via utility class names.

## Key Learnings

- **Tailwind Basics & Customization**: Strengthened knowledge of Tailwind utilities for layout, spacing, and responsive design.
- **Overlay Techniques**: Learned how to apply background/overlay elements (`absolute`, `z-index`) so they span the full page and sit consistently above or below content.
- **Units in CSS**: Experimented with using `rem` for scalable typography and `px` for fixed dimensions such as spacing, widths, and max-widths. I plan to explore this topic in more depth in the future to better understand best practices for choosing the right units in different contexts.
- **Deployment with Vite & GitHub Pages**: Improved workflow for publishing React + Tailwind projects online.
